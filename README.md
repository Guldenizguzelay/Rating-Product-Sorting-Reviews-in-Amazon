# Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon
Determining product ratings and ranking product reviews for e-commerce platforms.

## Business Problem

One of the most critical challenges in e-commerce is accurately calculating the ratings given to products after purchase. Solving this issue enhances customer satisfaction for e-commerce sites, helps products stand out for sellers, and ensures a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Another key challenge is the proper ranking of product reviews. Misleading reviews can impact sales directly, resulting in financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. Addressing these two core problems helps e-commerce platforms and sellers increase sales while providing customers with a smooth purchasing journey.
